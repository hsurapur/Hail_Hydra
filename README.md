## 🧬 What is Hydra?

**Hydra** is a curated multi-agent toolkit for AI coding CLIs — **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **Codex CLI**, and **GitHub Copilot CLI**. It ships 10 specialized agents pinned to each host's cost-effective models (Haiku/Sonnet on Claude Code, Flash tiers on Gemini, Luna/Terra on Codex), 10 commands for direct invocation, and one automatic touchpoint that recommends integration verification after substantial code changes — plus an opt-in `/hail-hydra` skill on Copilot with the same 10 roles on native subagents and no automatic hooks.

Each agent runs on the smallest model that can do its job well. When invoked, Hydra typically cuts per-task cost by **~50%** compared to running the same work on the orchestrator alone — while maintaining output quality through verification. That's the same ~50% you'll see everywhere Hydra is described, and it comes from one place: real session logs, via `/hydra:stats` (51.5% in the sample below).

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/hydra-stats-demo.svg" alt="/hydra:stats sample output — 51.5% saved, parsed from real session logs" width="680"/>
</p>

> **Think of it this way:**
>
> Would you hire a $500/hr architect to carry bricks? No. You'd have them design the building and let the crew handle construction. That's the model Hydra follows when you invoke a specialized head.

**New — GitHub Copilot CLI (opt-in):** use `/hail-hydra <task>` inside your existing
Copilot session. Normal messages keep the normal agent. No second CLI, API key,
background service or model-default change is needed. See [Copilot setup](#github-copilot-cli-opt-in).

**Multi-Host:** One canonical source (`content/`) generates a native payload per
host. Invoke with `/hydra:*` on Claude Code and Gemini CLI, `$hydra-*` skills on
Codex CLI, or `/hail-hydra <task>` on Copilot.

Everything else Hydra is known for is still here: persistent agent memory, the codebase map with blast-radius lookups, the sentinel verification touchpoint after substantial edits, internal-thinking compression (`/hydra:stfu`), and real token tracking with `/hydra:stats`. Full version history lives in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## When to Use Hydra Explicitly

Hydra's biggest cost savings come from explicit invocation in scenarios where specialized handling genuinely helps:

| Scenario | How to Invoke | Why It Saves |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Broad codebase exploration | "use hydra-scout to find X" | Haiku reads files faster and cheaper than Opus |
| Multi-file changes | "use hydra-coder to update X across these files" | Parallel Sonnet dispatch beats sequential Opus |
| Security review | `/hydra:guard` | Pattern matching is Haiku-cheap |
| Environment validation | `/hydra:preflight` | Cross-references compatibility matrices on Sonnet |
| Codebase architecture review | `/hydra:map` | Dependency graph stored locally |

For one-off questions, simple edits, or conversational work, the host handles it
directly. On Claude, Gemini and Codex, Hydra's only automatic intervention is the
post-substantial-edit sentinel directive. Copilot has no automatic intervention.

## 🚀 Installation

> **One command. Done.**

```bash
npx hail-hydra-cc@latest
```

Runs the interactive installer — pick your CLI(s) (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI)
and scope, and it deploys the agents, commands, hooks, and per-host wiring. Done in seconds.

### Installation Options

```bash
# Claude Code, all projects — no prompts (v2-compatible default)
npx hail-hydra-cc --global

# Pick your agent(s) explicitly
npx hail-hydra-cc --agent=claude --global
npx hail-hydra-cc --gemini --global
npx hail-hydra-cc --codex --global
npx hail-hydra-cc --copilot --global
npx hail-hydra-cc --agent=claude,gemini,codex,copilot --global

# Every detected agent, fully non-interactive
npx hail-hydra-cc --all --global --yes

# This project only / both scopes
npx hail-hydra-cc --claude --local
npx hail-hydra-cc --claude --both

# Preview what would be written (writes nothing)
npx hail-hydra-cc --dry-run --all

# Check what's deployed
npx hail-hydra-cc --status

# Remove everything
npx hail-hydra-cc --uninstall
```

All flags: `--agent=<list>` (`claude,gemini,codex,copilot`) or the aliases `--claude` /
`--gemini` / `--codex` / `--copilot` / `--all` (every detected agent) · scope `--global` /
`--local` / `--both` · `--yes` non-interactive (requires an agent selection) ·
`--dry-run` · `--config-dir <path>` config-dir override (single agent only) ·
`--status` · `--uninstall`.

### Per-Host Invocation

| Host | Commands | Notes |
|:-----|:---------|:------|
| **Claude Code** | `/hydra:help`, `/hydra:stats`, … | StatusLine + hooks registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `/hydra:help`, `/hydra:stats`, … | Restart Gemini CLI (or run `/commands reload`) to pick up the new commands |
| **Codex CLI** | `$hydra-help`, `$hydra-stats`, … (skills with a `$` trigger) | **Required once:** run `/hooks` inside Codex to review and trust the Hydra hooks — they stay inert until then |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `/hail-hydra <task>` | Run `/skills reload`; instruction-gated explicit requests, no hooks or persistent agent switch |

### GitHub Copilot CLI (opt-in)

Hydra is an **orchestration toolkit on top of the Copilot harness**, not a
replacement harness or model. Copilot provides sessions, tools, permissions
and subagent execution; Hydra supplies role prompts, task/mode policies and
local utilities. Those policies guide the agent, not a separate enforcement
runtime. Your selected main model remains responsible for the result.

Requires a Copilot CLI version that supports skills and explicit invocation.

```bash
npx hail-hydra-cc@latest --copilot --global --yes   # ~/.copilot/skills/hail-hydra (or $COPILOT_HOME)
npx hail-hydra-cc@latest --copilot --local --yes    # .github/skills/hail-hydra, this project only
```

The installer honors `COPILOT_HOME` for the global path; `--config-dir <path>` (Hydra's installer flag, not a Copilot setting) overrides it.

Then, **inside the same Copilot session**:

```text
/skills reload
/hail-hydra Implement pagination for this API and update the tests
/hail-hydra --mode turbo Build product search and run the relevant checks
/hail-hydra --help
```

`/hail-hydra` is an explicit skill invocation, not a sticky mode — a later message such as `Explain this function` uses the normal agent. The skill sets `disable-model-invocation: false` because some Copilot versions return `Skill not found` for explicit requests otherwise ([copilot-cli#4438](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/4438)); accidental model-mediated loading must not trigger Hydra work.

**Task-fit worker models** — no role-wide first-choice model. Catalogue entries
retain `cheap`/`mid` hints with `modelSelection: task-fit`; the main agent chooses
an actual host-available model for each unit's complexity, risk, context, tools
and mode. User model pins/exclusions take precedence. Turbo favors capability
and speed, Balanced weighs cost as well, and Economy uses inexpensive workers
only for suitable work. Your selected main model keeps difficult decisions and
final acceptance; its selection does not force every worker to use that model.

The skill instructs the agent to pass the chosen worker model explicitly and
record a short task-specific reason. The same model may fit several units;
artificial model rotation is not the goal. Requested and observed models are
reported separately when the host exposes them. This is instruction-guided
selection, not a live pricing/discovery engine or a guaranteed model mix.
If no suitable available worker can be identified, the main agent handles
the unit directly and discloses the limitation. No global model settings change.

**Modes:** `/hail-hydra --mode <turbo|balanced|economy> <goal>` (default `balanced`); Turbo puts speed first and costs more. Ceilings are instruction-level heuristics bounded by your Copilot plan's concurrency, not a scheduler guarantee.

**Slow or throttled MCPs:** Hydra decomposes large goals without another prompt,
but uses one fetch owner per shared service quota rather than sending every
worker to it. Deduplicate reads, use supported bulk/filter/page operations,
reuse sufficiently fresh results, and keep independent work progressing.
Service limits stay separate from agent limits, even in Turbo: default one
in-flight request, three attempts per read, twelve requests and a five-minute
elapsed budget per retrieval branch. These are conservative planning defaults,
not service SLAs. Respect `Retry-After`, bound retries and report partial results
or blocked data rather than endlessly retrying. Never replay an unresolved write.

The local `hydra-control.js service-policy` / `service-plan` adviser calculates
wait/retry decisions from explicit counters; it does not intercept MCP traffic,
hold cross-agent locks or enforce a timeout. A synchronous stuck tool may prevent
progress reporting until the host returns control. Hydra cannot speed up the
service or cancel unsupported calls; it must not issue duplicate calls while
one is still pending. No live-service benchmark or throttling fix is claimed.

**Quality:** substantial changes get an automatic in-task review via native `code-review`/`security-review` before completion is reported.

**Continuity:** treat a `/model` switch like a compaction boundary — write the session ledger before an anticipated switch, read it back before the next dispatch or decision.

**Measuring savings:** compare `/usage` before/after a normal run against a `/hail-hydra` run, then `/hail-hydra --compare`; not yet benchmarked on Copilot specifically.

**Hooks are deferred** until upstream hook reliability bugs are fixed (copilot-cli issues [#4520](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/4520), [#1730](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/1730), [#2201](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/2201), [#4001](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/4001), [#4549](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/4549)); quality gates and `--notify` run in-task/manually for now.

#### Copilot feature parity

The general feature list below spans several hosts; it is not a claim that
every feature runs unchanged on Copilot.

| Feature | Copilot implementation |
|---|---|
| Specialists, parallel work, mode/model routing | Native subagents guided by the skill; task ceilings are not scheduler guarantees. |
| Review, environment checks and dependency maps | In-task policies and explicit utilities, not always-on edit hooks. |
| Persistent per-agent memory | Not ported. Native memory and session checkpoints are used under their own scope/privacy rules. |
| Automatic token/cost collection and live savings display | Not ported. Native `/usage` plus explicitly supplied run receipts; no automatic measured saving or copied provider-price calculation. |
| Hook-driven completion sound and update notification | Deferred. Explicit `--notify` and `--update` remain available. |
| Shared-service backpressure | Fetch-owner instructions and a local retry adviser; no transport timeout, cross-session lock or MCP cancellation. |

Further parity needs host-specific adapters, not copying another CLI's hooks:
verify event coverage and task activation boundaries before installing hooks;
use explicit opt-in and native scoping for durable memory; validate supported
usage schemas, worker attribution and billing units before automatic reporting.
Every adapter must preserve user settings, ordinary unprefixed behavior and
ownership-aware uninstall. These are remaining requirements, not features
implemented by the service-coordination change.

> **`.claude/` collision:** Copilot also loads a project's `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/agents/`. A repo-local Claude Code Hydra install (`.claude/skills/hydra/`, auto-activating, and `.claude/agents/hydra-*.md`) will also be visible inside Copilot — install Claude Hydra globally, or remove the local copy, in repos where you use `/hail-hydra`.

```bash
npx hail-hydra-cc --copilot --status      # installed version + owned-file count
npx hail-hydra-cc --copilot --uninstall --yes
```

See `/hail-hydra --help` for the full command list.

```

Hooks and the statusLine are registered in `~/.claude/settings.json` — existing
entries are preserved, and a custom statusLine is never overwritten.

**Gemini CLI** — `~/.gemini/` (or `./.gemini/` with `--local`):

```

## ⚡ Slash Commands

> The following command catalogue and automatic integrations describe
> Claude/Gemini/Codex. Copilot has the separate opt-in skill documented above.

> **Codex CLI:** the same commands ship as skills invoked with a `$` trigger —
> `$hydra-help`, `$hydra-stats`, `$hydra-guard`, … The `/hydra:*` form below is
> for Claude Code and Gemini CLI.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/hydra:help` | Show all commands and agents |
| `/hydra:status` | Show installed agents, version, and update availability |
| `/hydra:update` | Update Hydra to the latest version |
| `/hydra:guard [files]` | Run manual security & quality scan |
| `/hydra:quiet` | Suppress dispatch logs for this session |
| `/hydra:report` | Report a bug, request a feature, or share feedback |
| `/hydra:stfu` | Compress internal thinking for every subagent in the session |
| `/hydra:map` | View codebase dependency map, query blast radius, rebuild |
| `/hydra:preflight` | Two-phase environment and compatibility check before starting a new project build |
| `/hydra:stats` | Show real token usage, delegation rate, and actual savings (parses the host CLI's own session logs — no AI estimation) |

### `/hydra:preflight` — Environment Validation

Run before starting any new project build. Catches broken GPU stacks, missing env
vars, and incompatible dependency pairs before they cost you hours of debugging.

```
/hydra:preflight
```

Hydra runs a two-phase check:
1. **Detection** (Haiku): probes runtimes, CUDA stack, deps, env vars, services
2. **Analysis** (Sonnet): cross-references against compatibility matrices, flags
   ✅ COMPATIBLE / ⚠️ KNOWN RISK / ❌ CONFIRMED BREAK

---

## 🖥️ Status Line

> Claude Code only — Gemini CLI and Codex CLI have no statusline; use
> `/hydra:stats` (or `$hydra-stats`) there instead.

After installation, your Claude Code status bar shows real-time framework info:

```
🐉 │ Opus │ Ctx: 37% ████░░░░░░ │ $0.42 │ my-project
```

| Element | What It Shows |
|---------|---------------|
| 🐉 | Hydra is active |
| Model | Current Claude model (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) |
| Ctx: XX% | Context window usage with visual bar |
| $X.XX | Session API cost so far |
| Directory | Current working directory |
| ⚠ Warning | Compaction warning (only at 70%+ context usage) |

**Context bar colors:**
- 🟢 Green (0–49%) — plenty of room
- 🟡 Yellow (50–79%) — getting full, consider `/compact`
- 🔴 Red (80%+) — context nearly full, `/compact` or `/clear` recommended

**Compaction warnings** (appended automatically at 70%+):
```
🐉 │ Opus │ Ctx: 73% ███████░░░ │ $1.87 │ my-project │ ⚠ Auto-compact at 85%
🐉 │ Opus │ Ctx: 83% ████████░░ │ $3.14 │ my-project │ ⚠ Compacting soon!
```
- ⚠ **Auto-compact at 85%** (70–79%) — heads-up that compaction is approaching
- ⚠ **Compacting soon!** (80%+) — compaction is imminent, consider `/compact` now

> **Note:** If you already have a custom `statusLine` configured, the installer
> keeps yours and prints instructions for switching to Hydra's.

---

## 🔔 Task Completion Sound

Hydra plays a short notification sound when the CLI finishes responding — so you know it's done even if you've tabbed away.

- **Cross-platform** — macOS (`afplay`), Windows (PowerShell), Linux (`paplay`/`aplay`)
- **Non-blocking** — the sound plays detached; it never delays the response
- **Host-native and fully event-driven** — Claude Code `Stop` hook, Gemini `Notification` hook, Codex `notify` chain that preserves your existing notifier; no prompt-level calls, so the model can't forget it

The notification hook is registered automatically during installation.

---

## 🔄 Auto-Update Notifications

Hydra checks for updates once per session in the background (never blocks startup).
When a new version is available, you'll see it in the status bar:

```
🐉 │ Opus │ Ctx: 37% ████░░░░░░ │ $0.42 │ my-project │ ⚡ v2.6.0 available
```

Update with:

```bash
# From within Claude Code:
/hydra:update

# Or from your terminal:
npx hail-hydra-cc@latest --global
```

After updating, restart Claude Code to load the new files.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Ten specialized heads** — Haiku (fast) and Sonnet (capable) heads for every task type, including preflight detection for new projects
- **Sentinel verification** — the answer to "did the cheap model's output actually hold up?": a two-tier check (fast scan + deep analysis) runs after code changes and catches ~72% of integration bugs before runtime
- **Persistent agent memory** — Every agent remembers your codebase patterns, conventions, and past decisions across sessions
- **Orchestrator memory** — Opus maintains its own notes on fragile zones, routing patterns, and known issues via CLAUDE.md
- **Verification touchpoint** — after substantial code changes, the auto-guard hook injects a directive recommending a sentinel + guard verification wave before results are presented; trivial edits stay silent
- **Auto-Guard** — a PostToolUse hook tracks every file edit; hydra-guard (Haiku) scans the tracked files for security issues on demand (`/hydra:guard`) or as part of the sentinel wave
- **Configurable modes** — `conservative`, `balanced` (default), or `aggressive` delegation via `hydra.config.md`
- **Slash commands** — `/hydra:help`, `/hydra:status`, `/hydra:update`, `/hydra:guard`, `/hydra:quiet`, `/hydra:report` for full session control
- **Task completion sound** — plays a notification when Claude finishes substantial tasks
- **Quick commands** — natural language shortcuts: `hydra status`, `hydra quiet`, `hydra map`
- **Custom agent templates** — Add your own heads using `templates/custom-agent.md`
- **Session indexing** — Codebase context persists across turns; no re-exploration on every prompt
- **Speculative pre-dispatch** — hydra-scout launches in parallel with task classification, saving 2–3 seconds per task
- **Dispatch log** — Transparent audit trail showing which agents ran, what model, and outcome
- **Codebase Map** — Persistent dependency graph built by hydra-scout. Maps every file's imports, dependents, risk score, env vars, and test coverage. Enables instant blast-radius lookups for sentinel — no more grepping the entire codebase.
- **Risk-Based Verification** — Files with more dependents get more thorough verification. Critical files always trigger deep sentinel analysis. Low-risk files get fast-tracked.
- **`/hydra:map`** — Inspect the dependency map, query blast radius for any file, or force a rebuild
- **🆕 Real Token Tracking** — `/hydra:stats` parses Claude Code session logs directly to show actual usage and savings. No AI estimation, no marketing fluff — just real numbers from Anthropic's API responses.
- **🆕 Internal Compression** — Subagent output and orchestrator responses are now compressed for efficiency. Sub-agent output is heavily compressed (only Opus reads it). Orchestrator responses drop filler and pleasantries while keeping natural prose.

## 🛡️ Sentinel — Integration Integrity

Most bugs don't come from bad code — they come from good code that **doesn't fit together**. A renamed export, a changed return type, a missing dependency after a refactor. These integration issues slip past linters, type-checkers, and even code review because no single file looks wrong.

**hydra-sentinel** catches them — the auto-guard touchpoint recommends a scan after every substantial edit, and the scan escalates to deep analysis only when it finds something.

### How It Works

```
Code change lands (hydra-coder finishes)
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🟢 hydra-sentinel-scan (Haiku)  │  ← Runs on EVERY code change (~1-2s)

          └── Complex (architectural): Report with context
```

### What Sentinel Catches

| Check Type | Priority | Example |
|:-----------|:---------|:--------|
| **Import/export mismatches** | P0 | Importing a function that was renamed or removed |
| **Function signature changes** | P0 | Caller passes 2 args, function now expects 3 |
| **Type contract violations** | P1 | Function returns `string` but caller expects `number` |
| **Missing dependency updates** | P1 | New import added but package not in `package.json` |
| **Cross-file rename gaps** | P1 | Variable renamed in definition but not all call sites |
| **Circular dependency introduction** | P2 | New import creates A → B → C → A cycle |
| **Dead code from refactoring** | P2 | Exported function no longer imported anywhere |
| **Environment/config mismatches** | P2 | Code references env var that isn't in `.env.example` |

### Example Output

```
🛡️ Sentinel Report
──────────────────────────────────────
✖ P0: src/auth.js imports `validateToken` from src/utils.js
       but src/utils.js now exports `verifyToken` (renamed in this session)
       → Fix: Update import to `verifyToken` [auto-fixable]

⚠ P1: src/api/routes.js calls createUser(name, email)
       but src/models/user.js:createUser now expects (name, email, role)
       → Missing required parameter `role` added in this change

✔ 6 other integration points verified clean
──────────────────────────────────────
```

Across the check types above, the estimated weighted detection rate is **~72%**
of integration bugs caught before runtime — highest for import/export and
dependency mismatches (direct matching), lower for type contracts and config
drift (heuristic).

> **Memory makes it better over time.** Sentinel remembers past false positives and known fragile
> integration points in your project. The more you use it, the more accurate it gets.

## 🗺️ Codebase Map

Hydra builds a persistent dependency map of your codebase,
giving every agent instant access to file relationships without scanning.

### How It Works

hydra-scout builds the map on first run by extracting import statements
from every source file using grep (no external parsers required). The map
is stored at `.claude/hydra/codebase-map.json`.

```
Session 1: scout builds the full map (~10 seconds for 500 files)
Session 2: scout checks git hash → nothing changed → skip rebuild (instant)
Session 3: scout checks git hash → 3 files changed → update only those 3
```

### What the Map Contains

| Data | How It's Used |
|:-----|:-------------|
| **File imports** | "auth.ts imports user.ts and env.ts" |
| **Reverse imports** | "auth.ts is imported by users.ts, admin.ts, middleware.ts" |
| **Risk score** | low (0-1 deps) → medium (2-3) → high (4-6) → critical (7+) |
| **Env var index** | "JWT_SECRET is used in auth.ts and middleware.ts" |
| **Test coverage** | covered / partial / untested per file |
| **Git staleness** | Hash comparison for instant freshness check |

### Why This Matters

**Without map** — When auth.ts changes, sentinel greps the ENTIRE codebase
looking for files that import it. In a 500-file project, that's 500 file reads.
Takes 5-15 seconds, costs 3,000-8,000 tokens.

**With map** — Sentinel reads the JSON, looks up auth.ts's `imported_by` array,
gets `[users.ts, admin.ts, middleware.ts]` instantly. Reads only those 3 files.
Takes <2 seconds, costs 500-1,500 tokens.

**Savings: 3-5× faster, 3-5× fewer tokens per sentinel scan.**

### Risk-Based Sentinel Triggering

The map's risk scores let Opus make smarter verification decisions:

| Modified File Risk | What Happens |
|:-------------------|:------------|
| 🔴 Critical (7+ deps) | Sentinel-scan + deep analysis (always) |
| 🟠 High (4-6 deps) | Sentinel-scan, escalate if issues found |
| 🟡 Medium (2-3 deps) | Sentinel-scan, escalate only for P0 issues |
| 🟢 Low (0-1 deps) | Sentinel-scan, auto-accept if clean |

This means Hydra spends more verification effort where it matters most
(high-risk files) and less where it doesn't (isolated utilities).

### Inspect the Map

```bash
/hydra:map                       # Show summary — risk distribution, coverage stats
/hydra:map src/services/auth.ts  # Show blast radius for a specific file
/hydra:map rebuild               # Force a complete rebuild
```

### Technical Notes

- The map is built using grep + regex — no Tree-sitter, no AST parsing, no
  external dependencies. Works with JS/TS, Python, Go, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Rust.
- Supports relative import resolution (e.g., `'./auth'` → `src/services/auth.ts`)
- Falls back gracefully — if the map doesn't exist, all agents use their
  original grep-based behavior. The map is an optimization, not a requirement.
- Stored at `.claude/hydra/codebase-map.json` — add to `.gitignore` (machine-generated).

## 📊 Real Token Tracking

`/hydra:stats` shows actual token usage and savings for your session. No AI
estimation. The numbers are pulled directly from the host CLI's own session
logs — Claude Code JSONL, Gemini CLI chat records, or Codex CLI rollout files.

```
🐉 Hydra Stats

```

The "All-Opus baseline" is the hypothetical cost if every Hydra agent had
been Opus instead. The savings show what Hydra's model routing actually
saves you in this session. Implementation is pure Node.js — works on
Windows, macOS, and Linux. Respects `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env override.

---

## 🧠 Agent Memory

Without memory, every session starts cold. Agents re-discover your conventions, re-learn your
project structure, and repeat the same questions. With memory, knowledge compounds.

| Aspect | Without Memory | With Memory |
|:-------|:---------------|:------------|
| **First task** | Agent explores from scratch | Agent recalls project patterns |
| **Conventions** | May use wrong style | Remembers your naming, structure, patterns |
| **Known issues** | No awareness of past bugs | Recalls fragile areas and past fixes |
| **Routing accuracy** | Generic classification | Improved by past dispatch outcomes |
| **False positives** | Same false alarms repeat | Sentinel suppresses known non-issues |

### How It Works

Every agent has `memory: project` in its frontmatter. Claude Code automatically manages a
per-project memory directory (`.claude/memory/`) where agents store and retrieve learnings.

> Agent memory is a **Claude Code** feature — Gemini CLI and Codex CLI have no
> equivalent, so the generator drops the `memory` field on those hosts.

| Agent | What It Remembers |
|:------|:------------------|
| **hydra-scout** | Project structure patterns, key file locations, search shortcuts |
| **hydra-runner** | Test commands, common failure patterns, build quirks |
| **hydra-scribe** | Documentation style, preferred formats, terminology |
| **hydra-guard** | Known false positives, project-specific security patterns |
| **hydra-git** | Commit conventions, branch naming, merge preferences |
| **hydra-sentinel-scan** | Known fragile integration points, past false positives |
| **hydra-coder** | Coding style, architecture patterns, preferred libraries |
| **hydra-analyst** | Common bug patterns, performance hotspots, review focus areas |
| **hydra-sentinel** | Integration history, confirmed vs dismissed findings |
| **Orchestrator (Opus)** | Fragile zones, routing accuracy, escalation patterns (via CLAUDE.md Hydra Notes) |

### Memory Properties

- **Automatic** — agents read and write memory without any user action
- **Project-scoped** — each project has its own memory; no cross-contamination
- **Persistent** — survives across sessions; compounds over time
- **Manageable** — stored as plain markdown in `.claude/memory/`; edit or delete anytime

### The Compound Effect

Session 1: Agents learn your project. Session 5: They know your conventions. Session 20: They
anticipate your patterns. The framework gets more efficient the more you use it — not because
the models improve, but because context quality improves.

## 🤔 Why I Built This

After Opus 4 dropped, I noticed something frustrating — code execution felt slowww. Reallyyy Slow. Not because the model was worse, but because I was feeding everything through one massive model. Every file read, every grep, every test run, every docstring — all burning through Opus-tier tokens. The result? Frequent context compaction, more hallucinations, and an API bill that made me wince.

So I started experimenting. I switched to Haiku for the simple stuff — running commands, tool calls, file exploration. Sonnet for code generation, refactoring, reviews. And kept Opus only for what it's actually good at: planning, architecture, and the hard decisions. The result surprised me. Same code quality. Sometimes better — because each model was operating within a focused context window instead of one overloaded one.

Five agents. Five separate context windows. Each with a clearly defined job. They do the work, and only pass results back to the brain — Opus. The outcome:

- Longer coding sessions (less compaction, less context blowup)
- Drastically reduced API costs (Haiku is 5× cheaper than Opus)
- Faster execution (Haiku responds ~10× faster)
- Same or better code quality (focused context > bloated context)
- Zero manual model switching (this is the big one)

Because that was the real pain — manually switching between models for every task tier to save costs. Every. Single. Time. So I built a framework that does it for me. And honestly? It does it better than I did. That was hard to admit, but here we are.

I also didn't want it to be boring. So I gave it teeth, heads, and a battle cry. If you prefer something more buttoned-up, the [`spec-exec`](../../tree/spec-exec) branch has the same framework with zero theatrics.

*Hail Hydra. Have fun.*

## 💡 The Theory (for nerds)

Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023) accelerates LLM inference by having a small **draft model** propose tokens that a large **target model** verifies in parallel. Since verifying K tokens costs roughly the same as generating 1 token, you get 2–2.5× speedup with **zero quality loss**.

Hydra applies this at the **task level**:

```
                          ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
                          │  SPECULATIVE DECODING (tokens)  │

                          │  Result: 2-2.5× speedup         │

                                  bigger scale
                                        │
                                        ▼
                          ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
                          │  🐉 HYDRA (tasks)               │
                          │                                 │
                          │  Haiku/Sonnet drafts the task   │
                          │  Opus verifies (quick glance)   │
                          │  Accept or redo yourself        │
                          │  Result: 2-3× speedup           │
                          └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

The math is simple: if 70% of tasks can be handled by Haiku (10× faster, 5× cheaper) and 20% by Sonnet (3× faster, ~1.7× cheaper), your effective speed and cost improve dramatically — even accounting for the occasional rejection.

How the concepts map:

| Speculative Decoding Concept | Hydra Equivalent |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------|
| Target model (large) | 🧠 The orchestrator (Opus / Gemini Pro / GPT-5.6 Sol) |
| Draft model (small) | 🟢🔵 The cheap/mid-tier heads |
| Draft K tokens | Heads draft the full task output |
| Parallel verification | Orchestrator glances at the output |
| Modified rejection sampling | Accept → ship it. Reject → orchestrator redoes it. |
| Acceptance rate (~70-90%) | Target: 85%+ of delegated tasks accepted as-is |

## ⚙️ Configuration

The following config applies to Claude, Gemini and Codex. Copilot uses
task-local `--mode turbo|balanced|economy` instead; it does not read this config
or treat `aggressive` as an alias for Turbo.

Customize Hydra's behavior with an optional config file — create it by hand at
your host's config path (the installer doesn't write one, and `--uninstall`
leaves it alone):

| Host | Global | Project-level (overrides global) |
|:-----|:-------|:---------------------------------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/hydra/config/hydra.config.md` | `.claude/skills/hydra/config/hydra.config.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/hydra/config/hydra.config.md` | `.gemini/hydra/config/hydra.config.md` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/hydra/config/hydra.config.md` | `.codex/hydra/config/hydra.config.md` |

```markdown
mode: balanced          # conservative | balanced (default) | aggressive
dispatch_log: on        # on (default) | off
auto_guard: on          # on (default) | off
```

Run `/hydra:status` (`$hydra-status` on Codex) to see what's currently loaded.
See [`content/config/hydra.config.md`](content/config/hydra.config.md) for the full reference with all options.

## 🧩 Extending Hydra

Add your own specialized head in three steps:

**1. Fetch the template** straight into the agents directory Hydra installed:
```bash
curl -o ~/.claude/agents/hydra-myspecialist.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR6420/Hail_Hydra/main/templates/custom-agent.md
# project-level: curl -o .claude/agents/hydra-myspecialist.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR6420/Hail_Hydra/main/templates/custom-agent.md
```

**2. Customize the agent** — edit the name, description, tools, and instructions.

**3. Restart your CLI** — the new head is discoverable alongside the built-in ten.

The template uses the Markdown agent format shared by Claude Code and Gemini CLI
(`~/.gemini/agents/`); Codex CLI agents live in `~/.codex/agents/` as TOML.
See [`templates/custom-agent.md`](templates/custom-agent.md) for the full template with
instructions on writing effective agent descriptions, output formats, and collaboration protocols.

## 📊 Expected Impact

| Metric | Without Hydra | With Hydra | Improvement |
|:-------|:-------------|:-----------|:------------|
| **Task Speed (per dispatch)** | 1× (Opus for everything) | 2–3× faster | 🟢 Haiku heads respond ~10× faster |
| **API Cost (per dispatch)** | 1× (Opus for everything) | ~0.5× per dispatch | ~50% cheaper when invoked |
| **Quality** | Opus-level | Opus-level | Zero degradation |
| **User Experience** | Normal | Normal | Explicit invocation; one automatic touchpoint (post-substantial-edit verification) |
| **Overhead per turn (Turn 2+)** | Full re-exploration each turn | Session index reused | 🟢 2-4s saved per turn |
| **Scout/runner verification** | Opus reviews every output | Auto-accepted for factual data | 🟢 ~50-60% of outputs skip review |
| **Integration bugs caught** | 0% (no verification) | ~72% caught before runtime | 🟢 Sentinel auto-verification |
| **Session knowledge** | Starts cold every time | Compounds across sessions | 🟢 Persistent agent memory |
| **Sentinel scan speed** | 5-15 seconds (grep) | <2 seconds (map lookup) | 🟢 3-5× faster with codebase map |
| **Sentinel scan tokens** | 3,000-8,000 per scan | 500-1,500 per scan | 🟢 3-5× fewer tokens per scan |

### How the Savings Work

| Task Type | % of Work | Model Used | Input Cost vs Opus | Output Cost vs Opus |
|:----------|:----------|:-----------|:----------------------|:-----------------------|
| Exploration, search, tests, docs | ~50% | 🟢 Haiku | 20% ($1 vs $5/MTok) | 20% ($5 vs $25/MTok) |
| Implementation, review, debugging | ~30% | 🔵 Sonnet | 60% ($3 vs $5/MTok) | 60% ($15 vs $25/MTok) |
| Architecture, hard problems | ~20% | 🧠 Opus | 100% (no change) | 100% (no change) |
| Sentinel scan (fast) | Auto (every code change) | 🟢 Haiku | 20% | 20% |
| Sentinel deep (conditional) | ~20-30% of code changes | 🔵 Sonnet | 60% | 60% |
| **Blended effective cost** | | | **~48% of all-Opus** | **~48% of all-Opus** |

Note: When Hydra is invoked across a representative mix of task types, blended input = (0.5×$1 + 0.3×$3 + 0.2×$5) / $5 = $2.40/$5 ≈ 48% of all-Opus.
Per-dispatch savings of **~50%** are typical for Hydra-invoked work. Session-level savings depend on how often Hydra is invoked — run `/hydra:stats` for real numbers from your session.

On Gemini CLI and Codex CLI the same routing applies against that host's own
frontier model — Flash-tier heads measured against an all-Gemini-Pro baseline,
Luna/Terra heads against an all-GPT-5.6-Sol baseline — landing around the same
~50% blended mark. `/hydra:stats` (`$hydra-stats` on Codex) reports real
per-host numbers.

### Why Hydra Doesn't Hit the Subagent Cost-Explosion Problem

A fair objection to any subagent framework: naive fan-out can cost **3–7× more**
than a single-thread session, because every spawned agent re-bootstraps context
and re-verifies work the orchestrator already understood. Hydra's design avoids
that trap deliberately:

- **Bounded, task-scoped dispatch** — the orchestrator sends one agent per
  well-defined subtask with only the context slice it needs, not a wide swarm
  re-reading the repo in parallel
- **Cheap tiers do the token-heavy work** — the expensive model never pays
  frontier prices for exploration, test runs, or doc writing
- **`maxTurns` caps on every agent** — a runaway agent stops at 25 turns
  (cheap tier) or 50 (mid tier) instead of burning tokens indefinitely
- **The codebase map replaces re-exploration** — blast-radius lookups cost
  ~500–1,500 tokens instead of a 3,000–8,000-token grep sweep per verification
- **Receipts, not claims** — `/hydra:stats` parses the CLI's own session logs,
  so if dispatch overhead ever ate the savings, the number would show it

### Measure Your Savings

The most accurate way to measure Hydra's impact — no estimation, real numbers:

1. Start a Claude Code session **without** Hydra installed
2. Complete a representative coding task
3. Note the session cost from Claude Code's cost display
4. Start a **new** session **with** Hydra installed
5. Complete a similar task
6. Compare the two costs

That's it. Real data beats theoretical calculations every time.

#### What to expect
When Hydra is actively invoked across a typical mix (50% Haiku, 30% Sonnet, 20% Opus):
- **Input tokens**: ~52% cheaper per dispatch ($2.40 vs $5.00 per MTok)
- **Output tokens**: ~52% cheaper per dispatch ($12.00 vs $25.00 per MTok)
- **Per-dispatch blended**: ~50% cost reduction on Hydra-invoked work
- **Speed**: 2–3× faster on delegated tasks

Session-level savings depend on invocation frequency. `/hydra:stats` reports real numbers from your session logs — no estimation.

### Additional Savings from Codebase Map

The codebase map provides additional token savings on TOP of the model-routing
savings above:

| Operation | Without Map | With Map | Savings |
|:----------|:-----------|:---------|:--------|
| Sentinel scan (per change) | 3,000-8,000 tokens | 500-1,500 tokens | ~3-5× |
| Scout exploration (repeat session) | 5,000-15,000 tokens | 1,000-3,000 tokens | ~3-5× |
| Blast radius computation | Grep entire codebase | JSON lookup | Instant |

These savings compound with every code change in a session. In a session with
5 code changes, the map saves roughly 10,000-30,000 tokens on sentinel scans alone.

## 🎯 Design Principles

### 🫥 Invisibility
> The user should **never** notice Hydra operating. No announcements, no permission requests, no process narration. If a head does the work, present the output as if the orchestrator did it.

### ⚡ Speed Over Ceremony
> Don't overthink classification. Quick mental check: "Haiku? Sonnet? Me?" and go. If you spend 10 seconds classifying a 5-second task, you've defeated the purpose.

### 🔀 Parallel Heads
> Independent subtasks launch in parallel. "Fix the bug AND add tests" → two heads working simultaneously.

### ⬆️ Escalate, Never Downgrade
> If a head's output isn't good enough, Opus does it directly. No retries at the same tier. This mirrors speculative decoding's rejection sampling — when a draft token is rejected, the target model samples directly.

## 🤔 FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Will I notice any quality difference?</strong></summary>
<br/>
No. Hydra only delegates tasks that are within each model's capability band. If there's any doubt, the task stays with Opus. And Opus always verifies — if a head's output isn't up to standard, Opus redoes it before you ever see it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this actually speculative decoding?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Not at the token level — that happens inside Anthropic's servers and we can't modify it. Hydra applies the same <em>philosophy</em> at the task level: draft with a fast model, verify with the powerful model, accept or reject. Same goals (speed + cost), same guarantees (zero quality loss), different granularity.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I'm not using Opus?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Hydra is designed for the Opus-as-orchestrator pattern, but the principles apply at any tier. If you're running Sonnet as your main model, you could adjust the heads to use Haiku for everything delegatable.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I customize which models the heads use?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Absolutely. Each head is a simple Markdown file with a <code>model:</code> field in the frontmatter. Change <code>model: haiku</code> to <code>model: sonnet</code> (or any supported model) and you're done.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do the heads work with subagents I already have?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Yes. Hydra heads coexist with any other subagents. Claude Code discovers all agents in the <code>.claude/agents/</code> directories. No conflicts.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I uninstall?</strong></summary>
<br/>

Removes all agents, commands, skills, hooks, and cache files, and reverses the
host wiring — hooks/statusLine in `~/.claude/settings.json`, hooks in
`~/.gemini/settings.json` plus the `GEMINI.md` marker block, and Codex's
`hooks.json`, `config.toml` marker blocks, and `AGENTS.md` block. Your own
configuration (including any `hydra/config/` files) is preserved.

```bash
npx hail-hydra-cc --uninstall              # every host with Hydra installed
npx hail-hydra-cc --uninstall --gemini     # just one host
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is Sentinel and how does it work?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Sentinel is a two-tier integration verification system. After every code change, <strong>hydra-sentinel-scan</strong> (Haiku) runs a fast sweep (~1-2s) checking imports, exports, function signatures, and dependencies. If it finds potential issues, <strong>hydra-sentinel</strong> (Sonnet) performs deep analysis to confirm real problems and dismiss false positives. The result is ~72% of integration bugs caught before they reach you.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Sentinel slow things down?</strong></summary>
<br/>
The fast scan adds ~1-2 seconds per code change. The deep analysis only triggers when the scan flags issues (~20-30% of changes), adding another ~3-5 seconds in those cases. For the ~70-80% of changes that are clean, you'll barely notice it. The time saved debugging integration issues far outweighs the scan overhead.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will Sentinel auto-fix things without asking?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Only trivial fixes (like updating an import path after a rename). For medium-complexity fixes (signature mismatches), it offers the fix for your approval. For complex architectural issues, it reports the problem with context but doesn't attempt a fix. You stay in control.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I disable Sentinel?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Yes. Set <code>auto_guard: off</code> in your <code>hydra.config.md</code> and the orchestrator skips the verification dispatch (the hook's post-edit reminder still appears — it's the orchestrator that honors the setting). Or use <code>mode: conservative</code> to make delegation, including verification dispatches, more sparing. The sentinel agents themselves stay installed — you can always invoke them explicitly.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Agent Memory use extra tokens?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Memory is loaded as part of each agent's context when it starts, so it does use some tokens — but agent memory files are small (typically a few hundred tokens each). The improved accuracy from having project context usually <em>saves</em> tokens by reducing re-exploration and misclassification.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where is agent memory stored?</strong></summary>
<br/>
In <code>.claude/memory/</code> within your project directory. Each agent stores its own memory as plain markdown files. You can read, edit, or delete them anytime. Memory is project-scoped — each project has its own memory, no cross-contamination.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Opus (the orchestrator) also have memory?</strong></summary>
<br/>
Yes. Opus maintains a "Hydra Notes" section in your project's <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file. This includes fragile integration zones, routing accuracy observations, and known issues. Unlike agent memory (which is per-agent), orchestrator memory is visible to all agents and informs dispatch decisions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the Codebase Map?</strong></summary>
<br/>
A persistent JSON file that maps every file's imports, dependents, risk score,
env var references, and test coverage. Built by hydra-scout using grep (no external
parsers). Stored at <code>.claude/hydra/codebase-map.json</code>. Enables instant
blast-radius lookups for sentinel instead of scanning the entire codebase.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to build the map manually?</strong></summary>
<br/>
No. hydra-scout builds it automatically the first time it's dispatched for
exploration. After that, it updates incrementally (only changed files) using
git hash comparison. You can force a rebuild with <code>/hydra:map rebuild</code>
or inspect it with <code>/hydra:map</code>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the map work with my language?</strong></summary>
<br/>
The map extracts imports using grep patterns for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python,
Go, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, and Rust. If your language isn't supported, agents fall
back to their original grep-based behavior — the map is an optimization, not
a requirement. More languages can be added in future versions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How big is the map file?</strong></summary>
<br/>
For a 500-file project, the map is typically 50-150KB. For a 5,000-file project,
it's around 500KB-1.5MB. It's a single JSON file — no database, no external
services, nothing to maintain.
